## **Requirements**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python** (>= 3.7)
- **Poetry** (>= 1.5.0): [Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- **Tox** (>= 4.0): Install via `pip install tox`
- **Make**: Pre-installed on most Linux/macOS systems; on Windows, use WSL or install Make via [choco](https://chocolatey.org/).

---

## **Setup**
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install project dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment created by Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

---

## **Using Makefile**
The `Makefile` provides shortcuts for common project tasks. To use it, run the appropriate `make` command in the project root.

### Available Commands
| **Command**   | **Description**                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `make install`| Install dependencies using Poetry.       |
| `make test`   | Run tests using Poetry and Pytest.       |
| `make tox`    | Run tests across multiple Python versions with Tox. |
| `make lint`   | Run code linting with Flake8.            |
| `make format` | Format code using Black.                 |
| `make clean`  | Clean up build and temporary files.      |

---

## **Dependency Management (Poetry)**
Poetry handles dependency installation, updates, and publishing for the project.

### Common Poetry Commands
1. **Add a Dependency**:
   ```bash
   poetry add <package-name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   poetry add requests
   ```

2. **Add a Development Dependency**:
   ```bash
   poetry add --dev <package-name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pytest
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry update
   ```

4. **Lock Dependencies**:
   Poetry automatically generates a `poetry.lock` file. To regenerate it:
   ```bash
   poetry lock
   ```

5. **Build and Publish the Project**:
   ```bash
   poetry build
   poetry publish
   ```

---

## **Testing with Tox**
Tox allows you to run tests in multiple Python environments.

### Running Tests
1. Install Tox if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install tox
   ```

2. Run tests across all environments specified in `tox.ini`:
   ```bash
   tox
   ```

3. Run tests in a specific environment (e.g., Python 3.9):
   ```bash
   tox -e py39
   ```

### Configuring Tox
The `tox.ini` file specifies the environments and dependencies for testing. Example:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py38, py39, py310

[testenv]
deps =
    pytest
commands =
    pytest
```

---

## **Common Tasks**

### 1. **Run Tests**
Use `Makefile` to simplify running tests:
```bash
make test
```

### 2. **Run Linting**
Run Flake8 linting using the `lint` target:
```bash
make lint
```

### 3. **Format Code**
Format code with Black:
```bash
make format
```

### 4. **Test in Multiple Environments**
Use Tox to test across Python versions:
```bash
make tox
```

### 5. **Clean Up Build Files**
Remove temporary files:
```bash
make clean
```

---

## **Contributing**
We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature/bugfix.
2. Ensure all code is formatted (`make format`) and passes linting/tests (`make lint`, `make test`).
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

---

### **Notes**
- For Windows users, consider using WSL or Git Bash for `make` support.
- This project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency configuration, managed by Poetry.

## **Understanding Makefile, Poetry, and Tox**

Here is a detailed comparison of **Makefile**, **Tox**, and **Poetry** to help you understand their distinct roles in a Python project:

| **Feature**           | **Makefile**                                      | **Tox**                                  | **Poetry**                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**    | Automate any task in the project (general-purpose).| Automate multi-environment testing.       | Manage dependencies, packaging, and publishing.|
| **Dependencies Management** | Relies on external tools (like Poetry or Pip).  | Uses dependencies from tox.ini or other files. | Manages dependencies in pyproject.toml.        |
| **Multi-Version Testing** | Needs to be scripted manually.                   | Built-in support for multi-version testing.| Not supported.                                 |
| **Task Customization**| Fully customizable (write any shell command).     | Focused on testing and Python tooling.    | Focused on Python dependency management.       |
| **Ease of Use**        | Requires manual scripting of tasks.              | Simpler setup for testing.                | Simplifies dependency and build management.    |

## **What is Linting?**
**Linting** is the process of analyzing your code to identify potential errors, style violations, and code quality issues. It ensures that your code adheres to best practices and coding standards.

### **Why Use Linting?**
- **Catch Errors Early:** Prevent bugs before running your code.
- **Improve Readability:** Maintain consistent and clean code.
- **Enforce Standards:** Ensure coding conventions are followed in team projects.
- **Simplify Debugging:** Cleaner code is easier to debug and maintain.

### **Examples of Issues Caught by Linters**
- Syntax errors (e.g., missing parentheses).
- Unused variables or imports.
- Style violations like inconsistent indentation or long lines.
- Logical issues, such as undefined variables.

### **Popular Python Linters**
1. **[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/):** Combines tools to catch bugs and enforce style guidelines.
   ```bash
   flake8 your_script.py
   ```
2. **[Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/):** Comprehensive linter with detailed suggestions.
   ```bash
   pylint your_script.py
   ```
3. **[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/):** Formats code automatically to follow a consistent style.
   ```bash
   black your_script.py
   ```
4. **[Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/):** Static type checker for Python code.
   ```bash
   mypy your_script.py
   ```

### **Using Linting in This Project**
- **Integrated with Makefile:** Run `make lint` to check for style and quality issues.
- **Automated with CI/CD Pipelines:** Ensure consistent code quality across contributors.

---

## **Summary**
- **Makefile** is a general-purpose automation tool that can run commands and scripts for any task.
- **Tox** simplifies testing across multiple environments and Python versions.
- **Poetry** manages dependencies, packaging, and publishing for Python projects.
- **Linting** ensures clean, readable, and maintainable code, helping to prevent errors early.

By using these tools together, you can automate repetitive tasks, streamline your workflow, and maintain high-quality code.
